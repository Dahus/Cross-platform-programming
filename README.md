The purpose of this assignment is to help you get started with vanilla JS development.

Using the scaffold in this repo and Figma materials, create an in-browser todo application that should be a "new tab" extension for Chrome. Please, use flexbox for html layout. Do not use frameworks, just vanilla js. Pre or post processors for styles are ok.

By the deadline, you should have your code in the repo and demo video on how the app works.

You will be graded based on the following criterias:

Todo list along with gauge is implemented according to the design provided with an ability to add a new task and mark it completed. Tasks are persisted in local storage and saved between page refreshes. (+6 points)

This is your final-boss React assignment.

Using the scaffold in this repo and [Figma materials](~https://www.figma.com/file/EOboZve1GjcyTjsPGFEPmk/Lab6-Poll-App~), create a full-featured React application that allows you to create, manage, participate, and watch the results for the online polls.
